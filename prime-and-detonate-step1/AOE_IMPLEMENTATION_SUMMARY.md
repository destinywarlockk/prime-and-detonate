# AOE Abilities Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented four new AOE abilities with super cost gating and no super gain on hit, along with their mechanical riders and targeting systems.

## Implemented Abilities

### 1. Nova AOE: Suppressive Barrage
- **Element**: Kinetic
- **Base Damage**: 15
- **Super Cost**: 40
- **Cooldown**: 1 turn
- **Targeting**: 3 random enemies
- **Rider**: Ignores 10% of target's shields for this hit
- **Class**: Vanguard

### 2. Volt AOE: Static Surge
- **Element**: Arc
- **Base Damage**: 12
- **Super Cost**: 40
- **Cooldown**: 1 turn
- **Targeting**: All enemies
- **Rider**: +100% damage vs targets with shields (double damage)
- **Class**: Technomancer

### 3. Ember AOE: Emberwave
- **Element**: Thermal
- **Base Damage**: 8
- **Super Cost**: 40
- **Cooldown**: 1 turn
- **Targeting**: 2 random enemies
- **Rider**: Applies Burn prime to each hit target
- **Class**: Pyromancer

### 4. Shade AOE: Entropy Collapse
- **Element**: Void
- **Base Damage**: 9
- **Super Cost**: 40
- **Cooldown**: 1 turn
- **Targeting**: 2 random enemies
- **Rider**: If target has primes, detonates them for bonus damage and applies Suppress (-25% damage dealt) for 1 turn
- **Class**: Voidrunner

## Technical Implementation

### Type System Updates (`src/game/types.ts`)
- Extended `Ability` type with new fields:
  - `targeting`: AOE targeting configuration
  - `riders`: Special mechanical effects
  - `superCost`: Super cost for abilities
  - `cooldownTurns`: Cooldown in turns
  - `grantsSuperOnHit`: Control over super gain
  - Added AOE-specific tags

### Ability Definitions (`src/content/abilities.ts`)
- Added four new ability objects with proper configuration
- Each ability has unique targeting, riders, and mechanics
- Proper class restrictions and element types

### Engine Mechanics (`src/game/engine.ts`)
- **Super Cost Gating**: Added validation to ensure sufficient Super before casting
- **Super Cost Deduction**: Automatically deducts Super cost on successful cast
- **Cooldown Support**: Added support for `cooldownTurns` field
- **AOE Execution**: New `executeAOEAbility` function with:
  - Targeting modes: 'all', 'n-random', 'n-closest'
  - Rider mechanics implementation
  - Proper damage calculation and application
  - Prime application and detonation handling
- **No Super Gain**: Prevents Super generation from AOE hits
- **Utility Functions**: Added conversion functions between PrimeType and DamageType

### Default Loadouts (`src/state/persist.ts`)
- Added `getDefaultLoadoutForCharacter` function
- Automatically assigns appropriate AOE ability to each class
- Applied when characters have no abilities selected

## Rider Mechanics Implementation

### Nova: Ignore 10% Shields
- Calculates shield ignore amount (10% of target's current shields)
- Adds this as bonus damage to bypass shield reduction
- Only applies when target has shields > 0

### Volt: Double Damage vs Shields
- Checks if target has any shields > 0
- Multiplies final damage by 2.0 when condition is met
- Applies to all targets in AOE

### Ember: Apply Burn Prime
- Uses existing prime system to apply Burn
- Respects max prime per target rules
- Applies to each successfully hit target

### Shade: Detonation + Suppress
- Calculates detonation bonus based on prime state:
  - Single prime: +30 damage
  - Same double: +43 damage  
  - Mixed double: +24 damage
- Consumes all primes after detonation
- Applies 1-turn Suppress debuff (simplified implementation)

## Testing

### Test File Created
- `aoe-test.html`: Comprehensive test page showing all abilities
- Includes stats, mechanics, and expected test results
- Provides testing instructions and implementation details

### Expected Test Cases
1. **Case A**: 3 unshielded enemies - verify base damage and targeting
2. **Case B**: 5 shielded enemies - verify Volt's double damage vs shields
3. **Case C**: 2 enemies with Burn - verify Shade's detonation mechanics
4. **Super Costs**: Verify 40 Super requirement and failure cases
5. **No Super Gain**: Verify abilities don't generate Super from hits

## Build Status
✅ **SUCCESS**: All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
✅ **SUCCESS**: Vite build completes successfully
✅ **SUCCESS**: No linter errors or type mismatches

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load the game**: Open `index.html` in the main directory
2. **Navigate to Loadout**: Each character should have their AOE ability automatically equipped
3. **Start Battle**: Ensure you have at least 40 Super to cast AOE abilities
4. **Test Mechanics**: Use the abilities to verify targeting, riders, and damage

## Notes

- **Minimal Changes**: Implementation follows existing code patterns and style
- **No File Deletion**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type checking
- **Extensible**: Rider system designed for easy addition of new mechanics
- **Performance**: Efficient targeting and damage calculation algorithms

The implementation successfully meets all specified requirements while maintaining code quality and following the project's architectural patterns.
